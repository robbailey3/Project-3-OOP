## Installation

Firstly, clone this project (`git clone`). Change directory into the folder (```cd```), then you will need to install the dependencies by running `npm install`.

## How to Run

To run the game, simply open the index.html file in a browser.

## How to Build

This game is 'bundled' using webpack (more on why I have used webpack later). Therefore, the code must be built (or compiled) before it can be run by a browser. To do this, simply open the console, navigate to the folder and enter:

```bash
npm run build
```
